    <h1>Testing Visualizations of Uncertainty</h1>

    <p>In the next minutes, you will be shown different visualizations of uncertainty. That data you will see is a series of points that could be generated from a GPS, for example, overlaid on top of a simple street map. You will be asked to identify the most or least uncertain of those points based on their visualization, which will indicate uncertainty in different ways.</p>

    <p>Please not that this test <strong>does not work on touchscreen devices</strong> such as smart phones or tablets. Please make sure that you are using a laptop or desktop computer if you would like to participate.</p>

    <p>Try moving your mouse pointer on the map. It will turn into a circle. You will be asked to place this circle on the point that you believe is the most or least uncertain on the map, and then click.
    </p>

    <p>Try to solve this task quickly, but do not rush it – we want you to consider the different points shown and then make a decision. There are no right or wrong answers – please select the point that you believe is most or least uncertain, based on the respective visualization. Participation should not take more than 10 minutes.</p>
