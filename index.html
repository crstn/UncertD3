    <h1>Testing Visualizations of Uncertainty</h1>

    <p>In the next minutes, you will be shown different visualizations of uncertainty. You will be asked to identify the most or least uncertain object on a map by placing a circle around the corresponding object, like in this example: Try moving the cursor inside the grey box. It will turn into a circle. You will be asked to place this circle on the objects that you believe are the most or least uncertain on the map and then press enter.
    </p>

    <div id='js-geojson-example' style="Width: 750px; height: 400px; border: 1px solid black; background-color: lightgrey; cursor: url(circle.png), auto;"></div>

    <p>Try to solve this task quickly, but do not rush it â€“ we want you to consider the different objects shown and then make a decision.</p>

    <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>. While we do capture the screen, your voice, and your pupil movement using the eye tracker, we will not store any personal information about you for this study. You can choose to abort the test at any point for any reason. In this case, your results will not be taken into account in our evaluation.</p>
